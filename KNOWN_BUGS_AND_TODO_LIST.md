# Known bugs

All code has been tested more times, no special issues are known at the moment.

Some features are in my TODO list:
  * interact with characters with dialogues lines as [requested by @blubabbler](https://github.com/unruhe73/python-adventure-game-engine/issues/1);
  * adding sound for some actions.
