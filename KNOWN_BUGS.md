# **Describe

When you act on an item in a room you act using its name.
Example:
  describe crystal

Suppose there are more than one crystal in the room. There is a blue crystal, a white one and so on.
If you just say:
  describe crystal

the action will describe just the first crystal in its list, and usually it's the first in the room description as you see it.
The other crystals will be ignored.

What can be the correct description action in this case? Maybe it is: describe all the crystals in the room.
Same for the inventory.

Or maybe it's: sorry, more than a crystal found. I don't know what to choose.
