# **Describe

When you act on an item in a room you act in its name.
Example:
  describe crystal

Suppose there are more than on crystal. There is a blue crystal, a white one and so on.
If you say just:
  describe crystal

it will describe the first crystal in its list, and usually it's the first in the room description.
The other crystals will be ignored.

What can be the correct description action in this case? Maybe it is: describe all the crystals in the room.
Same for the inventory.
