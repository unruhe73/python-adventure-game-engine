This is a new project. An Adventure Game Engine written in Python. You can create an adevnture game just describing it in a JSON file and playing it with the python engine running main.py file. Lots of things has to be included in the engine. This is just a basic version. Lots of feature can be implemented. For example, a JSON GA validator method has to be written to avoid that malformed JSON file produce a crash of the engine.

I will try to document in the nex days the JSON file structure.

At the current state the JSON file structure can change and the example JSON file game will change its contents while new features will be added or bugs resolved.
